<P align="justify"><B>Loretta "Ell" Hankins, CWS</B><br><br>Loretta's sparkling personality and warm, friendly nature make her a natural hostess for any event.  It is her ability to visualize the dreams of others and her talent to translate those dreams into reality that make her a consummate wedding specialist.  Fifteen years in the medical field caring for neonatal as well as geriatric patients gave Ell a deep appreciation for being on time, a keen eye for attention to detail and to perceive problems, and the ability to improvise to get the job done.  She has said, "When you work in the medical field there is no room for error or tardiness."<BR>
<BR>
In December of 1992, Jeff, an oilfield services design engineer, proposed to Ell while on a Christmas ski vacation in Idaho. Of course she said, "YES", and shortly thereafter they began planning for a Texas Hill Country wedding on their property west of Austin.  Because they wanted their wedding to be unique and symbolic in the most subtle ways, they could not bear to share control over their special day. The result was Ell's first adventure into the world of wedding planning.<br>
<Br>
Fifteen months later, April 16, 1994, her first "Dream Wedding" and unknowingly at that time, the birth of a new business, <I>TEX-ZEN DREAMS</I>, was realized.  Both Ell and Jeff were overwhelmed by the response of their many guests as they had repeated inquiries for use of the rural and rustic ranch for special events, and more importantly for Ell's help.  This demand was the seed that pushed her to grow a new and enjoyable career.<Br>
<Br><img src="wedimg/DSCF0375.jpg" align="left" alt="Weddings Beautiful Certificate - Registry No. W980" hspace=10 vspace=3 border=0>
As a wife, a mother and a grandmother, life has taught Ell a profound appreciation and love for family and friends.  As a former scuba diver, and now gardener and someone who enjoys hiking and bird watching, nature has taught her a deep respect for the environment.  While helping others to create their own dream weddings, effort has taught her to be devoted to her chosen vocation.  And this is why after many years of working at what she loves, Ell is now proud to announce that as of April, 2004, she has completed the comprehensive training course from the prestigious "Weddings Beautiful Worldwide" and is a member of the National Bridal Service Organization based out of Richmond, Virginia.  She is now a nationally certified wedding and event specialist, adding CWS to her list of credentials.<BR>
<BR>
Ell's motto is "Every Event a Dream Come True".  Hers has.  Now, let her help you make a dream come true.
