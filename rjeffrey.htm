<P align="justify"><B>R. Jeffrey Hankins, Rev.</B><br><br>Jeff is an engineer by education and profession, with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Southern California. He has been designing and engineering tubular systems with oilfield service companies in Houston since he moved from California in 1979. His design and hands-on talent as well as his attention-to-detail perfectionism lead him to construct the gazebo and design and build the bridge pictured on the Tex-Zen Dreams logo as well as the water barn and guest cottage at Tex-Zen Ranch. Some of Jeff's other design and construction projects seen on the property include the low-water creek crossing, rose garden, dam re-construction, house remodeling, ornamental waterfall and lily ponds, the spa gazebo at the guest cottage, and the zipline cable ride. With exception of the existing residence, Jeff and his personable and lovely wife Loretta have performed nearly 100% of the construction work on the property.  Mentally and physically, Jeff has maintained fitness over his lifetime by actively participating in various sports including softball, tennis, water skiing, bowling, running, road biking, snow skiing, scuba diving, and most recently, adventure racing, a multi-sport team activity usually involving running, mountain biking, kayaking, and trekking/orienteering. Jeff is a member of the Houston chapter of the USA Fit AR team.<BR>
<Br>Jeff is also a minister by ordainment, and in such capacity he performs weddings and other nondenominational religious ceremonies. Of course, nondenominational means that there is no affiliation with a particular religion.  Nondenominational weddings usually but not necessarily occur when the couple is of mixed faiths. Jeff believes that it’s only fair and maybe a good idea for you to know a little about him, his life and his beliefs so that if you choose him to officiate your ceremony you may be assured with implicit trust that he truly cares about you, your marriage, and your ceremony.  When Jeff helps a couple design their specific wedding ceremony, he likes to get to know one another.  He will ask you to tell him about yourselves, as well as what type of ceremony you want. If you’re not sure, with your coordinator's assistance, he will be able to make some suggestions based on what he knows about you.  Jeff is big on symbolism and personalization and knowing a bit about you helps to bring these together even in the simplest ceremonies.  So, relax . . . the purpose of the interview is not for him to judge you or your fitness for marriage.  <BR>
<Br>
   Jeff is a Christian, and one of his required beliefs as an ordained minister is freedom of religion, that we are all free to do and worship as we will, provided we do not infringe on the rights and freedoms of others.  Jeff has agreed to spread the word of Christianity in his own way, but as religion is a personal matter, he cannot force his views on anyone and he will not impose his religious convictions on you . . . He does not use the wedding ceremony as a platform to promote his beliefs.<Br>
<Br><img src="wedimg/credentialofministry.jpg" align="left" width=260 height=200 alt="Credential of Ministry" hspace=10 vspace=3 border=0>
The joy and laughter, the romance, the symbolism, the power of the moment, and the celebration of love – is an emotional experience for Jeff, so don’t be surprised if he has to take a perceptible pause to choke back the words that he speaks for you.  “The honorable estate of matrimony is not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently and soberly.”  Marriage is the most powerful and important event to take place in your lives and to officiate such an occasion is also sobering and humbling.  Whether it’s a gala event in a grand resort hotel or a simple, private, short-but-sweet ceremony in a backyard or in the country, Jeff will strive to make your wedding everything that you want.  It is your wedding and this is something that he respects. The couple is the highest priority. The promises, words, and vows you speak and make in a short-but-sweet event are no less meaningful, no less powerful, no less important, and no less lawful.<BR>
<BR>
Final words - On your wedding day you must be relaxed and comfortable.  Embrace all your feelings and emotions.  Savor every precious moment (because the ceremony will be over in a flash!).
