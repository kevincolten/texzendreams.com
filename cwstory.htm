<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>This story was first written to answer a call for country-western wedding experiences in "Wedding Belles" by </I>Country Woman Magazine.<I> After the magazine had our story, original cards and photographs for over seven months, we were informed that another lengthly amount of time was needed to review the hundreds of submissions for a later publication. We started getting nervous about the photos getting lost, therefore we requested our submission be returned. Consequently, no part of our story was published. So, here it is now.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size=5><b>J</b></font>eff and I met ten years ahead of our finest hour while I was teaching country-western dancing at the college. Jeff was one of my students, but without a dance partner. Well, that's another story, but needless to say, it was fitting for us to choose a country-western style theme.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size=5><b>W</b></font>e planned a creek-side wedding in the springtime, one of the prettiest times of the year at our Texas Hill Country ranch less than 35 miles west of Austin. The initial planning began more than 15 months in advance after Jeff proposed while on a Christmas ski trip in Idaho. All this time, and more, was needed because we were so strong in our resolve for everything to be just right.

For some reason we couldn't let anyone else do any of the preparations.  We chose blank verse cards embossed with Texas Bluebonnets and Jeff created our Engagement Announcement, Invitation, Reception Card &amp; Map, Service Card, Marriage Announcement, Seating Card, and Thank You Card on his computer.  I designed and arranged all the flowers including the bridal bouquet, corsages and boutonnieres, a wildflower wreath, and baskets of silk wildflowers for the altar and reception tables.</P>

With that completed in January, we then spent the next two chilly winter months building a big 15 x 20 ft gazebo within which we would recite our vows. </P>

The perfectly appropriate <i>"Love Can Build A Bridge"</i> by The Judds. We also chose some old and some new Country Western songs with special lyrics and meanings for play during the 30 minute prelude to the ceremony and during the reception. Standing for Jeff was my brother-in-law and Nashville recording artist, Joe Lester. He would sing two of our personal favorites ("I Swear" and Joe's own "Grains of Sand") to punctuate parts of the ceremony.</P></td><TD WIDTH=5" VALIGN="TOP" ></td>

A party tent for the reception was filled with tables draped in white and adorned with the baskets of wildflowers I had made. Horseshoes were placed alongside for luck. My sisters made silk rose-buds and filled them with seeds for our guests to throw. Our beautiful multi-layered gazebo-style wedding cake sat on a table nestled beneath the canopy of stately live oaks and elms. The bride's cake and the groom's cake shared the table. Symbolic of the theme song lyrics, <i>"Love Can Build a Bridge Between Your Heart and Mine"</i>, these two heart-shaped delicacies were joined by a 1/20 scaled replica (Jeff made) of the bridge.

Joe continued along a path to a hidden spot on the creek where my two sons, Fred and Chris, and my sister, Candie, stood with me. Joe escorted Candie back along the path, across the bridge and into the gazebo. My sons then escorted me to join hands with Jeff at the bridge. The boys shook hands with Jeff, kissed my cheek and placed my hands in Jeff's. While Fred and Chris crossed the bridge to the gazebo, Jeff and I stood alone together, again in unison with the song lyrics "When We Stand Together, It's Our Finest Hour".

I would gladly walk across the desert<br>
with no shoes upon my feet<br>
to share with you the last bite<br>
of bread I had to eat.<br>
<br>
I would swim out to save you<br>
in your sea of broken dreams<br>
when all your hopes are sinking<br>
let me show you what love means...<br>
<br>
Love can build a bridge<br>
between your heart and mine.<br>
Love can build a bridge...<br>
Don't you think it's time?<br>
<br>
I would whisper love so loudly<br>
every heart would understand<br>
that love and only love<br>
can join the tribes of man.<br>
<br>
I would give my hearts desire<br>
so that you might see<br>
the first step is to realize<br>
that it all begins with you and me.<br>
<br>
Love can build a bridge<br>
between your heart and mine.<br>
Love can build a bridge...<br>

Because we had requested no gifts, we asked each guest to bring their favorite covered dish or dessert to go with bar-b-que, and to include a written recipe for my bride's memory recipe book. These delicious "pot-luck" recipes were served with the likewise delicious beef brisket, pork ribs, chicken and sausage that was prepared by our local BBQ chef. To show our gratitude (for many people had to travel 200 miles or more), we had purchased special prize gifts and created certificates of appreciation for best: "hot" dish, meatless dish, appetizer, and dessert.

A Toast . . .<br>To the Newlyweds,<br>Loretta and Jeff</b><br><br>
<font size=1>By Bob Bancroft<br><br>April 16, 1994<br><br>Jeff,<br><br>

To the altar you've not been before -<br>
Let this be first and last.<br>
Yes, the altar is the prelude to<br>
The love that will be cast.<br>
<br>
The fact that you have waited long<br>
Will show the strong resolve.<br>
And efforts made by the two of you<br>
Shall ensure that love evolve.<br>
<br>
Loretta and Jeff you've shown to us<br>
Your sense of creativity,<br>
By building on this land of yours,<br>
A bridge of great stability.<br>
<br>
We know that love has really built<br>
This bridge of steel and wood.<br>
Though, Loretta may not have drawn the plans,<br>
We know she did much good.<br>
<br>
With this review of what's been done<br>
On this Hill Country of stone,<br>
We hope to be invited back<br>
When there becomes a home.<br>
<br>
We share your dreams of happiness<br>
That this site will surely bring.<br>
For we know this place in Dripping Springs<br>
Is where good times will ring.<br>
<br>
To the newlyweds, Loretta and Jeff,<br>
In the heart of Texas lands,<br>
We toast you many happy times,<br>
Which your great love commands.<br>

We also received a number of inquiries from family, friends, and friends of friends about the availability of our idyllic setting for their own wedding.

In fact, Fred and Diane can be viewed (at the time of this writing) at our creek-side setting by accessing their photographer's web page at www.concentric.net/~weddings. I am currently in the process of setting up to host and coordinate weddings several times a year at the ranch. Every time another couple crosses our bridge I will realize how truly special our wedding was. </P>
