<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">V</B>icki is the name of my ebay friend.<br>
We met in the heat of a bid.<br>
If not for my message the story would end,<br>
But my name was the same as her kid.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>A</B>ggressive and persistent she did prevail,<br>
On a Chevron truck auction that day.<br>
So a message to her I did send by email:<br>
"Congrat's and what fun on ebay".<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>W</B>ith apologies for winning she did reply,<br>
And I countered for her not to worry.<br>
For my collection of trucks was great in supply,<br>
And to complete it there is not a hurry.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>F</B>or awhile we spent sharing our joys of selling,<br>
And buying, and collecting all that (our c---).<br>
We both had our stories and both enjoyed telling<br>
News 'bout Chevron and bubble wrap.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>hen one day off the top of her head<br>
Came a question of personal measure.<br>
And so I responded that we stick instead<br>
To discussions 'bout ebay for pleasure.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>B</B>ut that put her off and into a huff,<br>
And I couldn't communicate with her.<br>
My admission of guilt wasn't even enough<br>
To bring back my friend Vicki Fisher.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>U</B>pon us then was the holiday season,<br>
And the New Year preoccupied us all.<br>
I made lots of buys but for some reason<br>
I missed someone I met that Fall.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>hose winter weeks went on and on,<br>
It seemed forever and a day.<br>
The fun was over and the spark was gone<br>
Between two pals hooked on ebay.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>hen it came to my delight,<br>
An email, just out of the blue.<br>
My pal Vicki, a little contrite,<br>
But she had been lonely too.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>W</B>e proceeded to share our news once again,<br>
Our stories of buyer and seller.<br>
But personal questions I resolved not to refrain<br>
From answering - I would just tell her.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>S</B>he wanted a truck for Jeffrey 2's boy.<br>
Then, our emails were not very heavy.<br>
But a Chevron truck isn't considered a toy,<br>
So I sent her a reissued Chevy.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/chevy.gif" ><br>
<B>I</B>n the dog house again I was gratefully not.<br>
So we went on with our lightened emails.<br>
But then did I bid and alas I had bought<br>
Her "Ships and Narrow Gauge Rails".<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>A</B> very good price it was so indeed<br>
A nice book to give to my dad<br>
But Vicki did think that she was in need<br>
Of a way to offset it a tad.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>he cost without postage she then provided<br>
And promptly I paid her the price<br>
But business is business and so I decided<br>
To send one more check to be nice.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>o Vicki that action just wasn't right,<br>
For she wished to reciprocate<br>
The gesture that I had made one night,<br>
While working at home so darn late.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>B</B>ack in the dog house there I was,<br>
But that would soon be stopping.<br>
Redeemed I had a chance because<br>
Her photos needed cropping.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/vtrain.gif" ><br>
'<B>T</B>was a pic she had, it needed mending -<br>
Just a slight correction.<br>
How grateful she was, for me sending<br>
Her train in the right direction.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/htrain.gif" ><br>
<B>Y</B>es, Vicki needed some help with shrinking<br>
Her photos to keep her files small.<br>
So within just a minute and without even thinking<br>
I had shrunk not just one but them all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>A</B>nd then unto me a new job on my platter,<br>
Shrinking and cropping her pics.<br>
Day in and day out it didn't matter,<br>
I liked helping and teaching her tricks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>hen low and behold one fine early morning<br>
A package from Vicki was found.<br>
A private surprise though not without warning,<br>
But my colleague kept hanging around.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>rucks or toys it did not yield,<br>
I was glad to find the news -<br>
A special treat from Bakersfield -<br>
A sack of Dewar's Chews.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/chews.jpg" ><br>
<B>S</B>till Vicki yearned to learn the ropes,<br>
Frustration soon set in.<br>
I wrote a 'script all in the hopes<br>
Comprehension could begin.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>S</B>hrinking pics and making wine,<br>
Unrelated you might think.<br>
You wouldn't believe that story of mine<br>
Just tickled her ever so pink.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>O</B>f trucks and trains and books and bidding,<br>
We wrote and played a fun game.<br>
Of jams and jellies, cameras and kidding -<br>
She tried to guess my first name.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>O</B>f CIA agents and postage scales,<br>
We talked of many things -<br>
Of guessing URL details<br>
For my ranch in Dripping Springs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>R</B>anch and jam? Quite a spread!<br>
For awhile we chewed the fat.<br>
Then a thought came to her head,<br>
"How did he get into that?"<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"<B>M</B>y tomato jam is second to none"<br>
A statement she proudly did share.<br>
"Maybe I'll give you a recipe that won<br>
First place at the Kern County Fair."<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"<B>V</B>icki's the name, bribery's my game.<br>
The recipe I will confess.<br>
I'll give you the jam, but please, in God's Name<br>
Give me that web site address!"<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>W</B>hile shrinking more pics another book I did find<br>
A Charles Russell it was this time.<br>
But she'd stop the auction - she didn't mind,<br>
It would not even cost me a dime.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>N</B>o, I couldn't do that so the minimum I paid,<br>
And I added some postage in too.<br>
But that was too much for guess what she said:<br>
"There's a surprise in the package for you!"<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>M</B>ore chews, maybe seeds, what might it be?<br>
Until Thursday I'd just have to wait.<br>
No, I couldn't stand it, Hmmm, let me see,<br>
On Wednesday, I would stay late.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>S</B>neaking into a desk I did find the key<br>
To that mailbox sized 18 by 9.<br>
Oh what did that Vicki bestow unto me?<br>
A book 'bout California Wine.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>U</B>nder pressure she yielded, couldn't take anymore.<br>
That recipe finally would come.<br>
Oh no, I was tricked, with the recipe for<br>
Vicki's old time Hot Buttered Rum!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>W</B>ell, finally with hints, she discovered my site.<br>
Relieved were we both I might say.<br>
For I needed a jam, it just would be right<br>
To introduce at our town Founder's Day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>hen of Armanis we did have a chat<br>
And of photos that looked so much better.<br>
An ebay buddy - simple as that.<br>
I was so lucky to have met her.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>O</B>h the jam was a hit. It was the best.<br>
On my anniversary it was a thrill.<br>
That pretty red jar stood out from the rest<br>
On that special sixteenth day in April.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/trio.gif" ><br>
<B>N</B>ow it was my turn to give her a treat,<br>
And for Vicki it would be free - Oh,<br>
And it was my turn to give something sweet,<br>
So I sent her our new Tex-Zen Trio<SUP>&trade;</SUP>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>V</B>icki's not timid, she's got her views,<br>
And so happy to do her good deeds.<br>
Then there it was, another box full of chews,<br>
And for Loretta a bag full of seeds.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>I</B> shake my head. I can't compete<br>
With this woman oh so kind,<br>
For if I do the slightest feat,<br>
A gift from her I'll find.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>I</B>'ve told my secrets too, and how<br>
Her pics deserve much praising.<br>
My shrinking jobs are over now.<br>
Her pics are just amazing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>S</B>urprised again, what am I to do?<br>
For she asked if I had seen<br>
The gift of a subscription to<br>
The E-bay Magazine.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>hanks for everything it was signed,<br>
And Given With Best Wishes.<br>
More bribery must be on her mind,<br>
But I couldn't use her dishes!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>H</B>er scale was what I really needed.<br>
She offered "such a deal".<br>
"Bid high to win" was what she pleaded,<br>
But I ignored her wise appeal.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>T</B>he scale was lost that night so late.<br>
A sniper did me in.<br>
But Vicki did not hesitate<br>
To offer yet again.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"<B>I</B>'ll just order one direct"<br>
A favor she would do.<br>
Soon she said I could expect<br>
A scale brand-spanking new.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>M</B>y chews were running low, you see,<br>
And subscriptions needed paying.<br>
But Vicki had a job for me<br>
To help with her Ebaying<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>S</B>ee Vicki tried to add some text<br>
To annotate her pics.<br>
But couldn’t figure what came next -<br>
She didn’t know the tricks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<B>H</B>er off-brand program wasn’t good -<br>
The text it wouldn’t set.<br>
But that’s my call, for now I could<br>
Help pay my rising debt.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Jeff thought Vicki was mad at him,<br>
And Vicki asked Jeff not to mention that again.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But Jeff, without thinking, brought it up one more time<br>
That is the reason for this addendum to his epic rhyme.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The e-mails began just for fun,<br>
Congratulations from Jeff for an auction won.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A single fire truck was Vicki's desire,<br>
But Jeff was accumulating his Chevron Empire.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/firetruck.gif" ><br>
Vicki offered to sell part of her win,<br>
Jeff said, "no thanks", I already have 210.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
They shared a few laughs and talked about eBay,<br>
Nothing personal - just a note every few days.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Questions about Chevron were an excuse to write,<br>
Jeff always answered and was always polite.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The e-mails were impersonal and on an even keel,<br>
Talks about eBay and Lledo trucks made of steel.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Then Vicki began wondering about Jeff's Texas life,<br>
What was his profession, did he have kids and a wife?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One morning while reflecting on the death of a child,<br>
Vicki sent Jeff an e-mail that was anything but mild.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
An impending trip had Vicki filled with dread,<br>
She wrote down her thoughts - didn't care what she said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The letter, though well written, became a scary e-mail<br>
Jeff would be shocked and would say, "What the h---?"<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With a touch of a finger the message was sent,<br>
No time for retraction as the e-mail on its way went.<br>
<IMG SRC="funimg/EmailComps.gif" ><br>
Embarrassed and ashamed of the message Jeff would receive,<br>
Vicki knew the words could not be retrieved.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Frustrated, uncomfortable, wondering if she was nuts,<br>
Vicki stopped writing because she had spilled her guts.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Too proud to write and simply say,<br>
"I'm sorry Jeff, I knew our relationship was strictly eBay"<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So Vicki stopped writing shortly after that<br>
But she knew she would miss their eBay chats.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
How could Vicki apologize with her pride in the way?<br>
But she missed her eBay buddy and so one-day...<br>
